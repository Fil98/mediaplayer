# Media Player

Media player app using [Framework7 HTML Framework](http://framework7.io/) and the [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/).


### Requirements

- PhoneGap 

### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/Fil98/mediaplayer/
cd mediaplayer
copy path to folder with project
```

### View

You can now view the app either in a browser at`localhost:3000`


Of course, all the other PhoneGap CLI commands work as expected.

```
phonegap platform add ios
phonegap run ios
cordova platform add android
cordova run android --device
```
